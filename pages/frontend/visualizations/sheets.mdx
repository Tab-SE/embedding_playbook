# Embedding Tableau Sheets

Embedding Tableau refers to the process of integrating Tableau visualizations, dashboards,
or reports into external applications, websites, or portals. This capability allows organizations
to enhance their data-driven decision-making by seamlessly incorporating Tableau's powerful
analytics and visualization features directly within their existing systems. Embedding Tableau
is achieved through the use of Tableau's JavaScript API or the Tableau Embedding SDK, enabling
developers to customize and control the appearance and behavior of Tableau content within their
applications.

One key advantage of embedding Tableau is the ability to maintain a cohesive user experience.
Users can access and interact with Tableau visualizations without leaving the context of the parent
application. This seamless integration fosters a more intuitive and efficient workflow, as users can
analyze and explore data within the familiar environment of the host application. Additionally,
embedding Tableau facilitates real-time data updates and interactivity, ensuring that users always
have access to the most current insights.

Furthermore, embedding Tableau supports a broader reach for data-driven insights. Organizations can
share their Tableau visualizations with a wider audience by integrating them directly into external
portals or websites. This not only enhances accessibility but also enables businesses to communicate
data-driven narratives effectively, making it easier for stakeholders and decision-makers to grasp
insights and make informed choices based on the embedded visualizations.

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML standard that allows secure web domains to exchange user authentication and authorization data. You can configure Tableau Server to use an external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate users over SAML 2.0. No user credentials are stored with Tableau Server, and using SAML enables you to add Tableau to your organization’s single sign-on environment.

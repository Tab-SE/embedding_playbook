### Subscription-based Services

Explore the possibility of offering subscription-based services for appliance maintenance, repairs, or even appliance rentals. This can provide a recurring revenue stream and foster long-term customer relationships.


### Personalization and Customization

Implement a configurator that allows consumers to personalize and customize their appliances based on their preferences, such as color, finishes, or additional features. This can enhance the perceived value and create a unique buying experience.

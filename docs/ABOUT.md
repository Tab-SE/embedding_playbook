# About this App

Embed Tableau was created with [Nextra](https://nextra.site), a documentation template built with the [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) web framework that uses [React](https://react.org/) to generate cutting-edge static webapps while content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), an industry standard language for documentation. The app can be hosted on [Nextjs](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=home) or [self-hosted](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

This architecture was selected for the following reasons:
1. [React](https://react.org/) is great for creating dynamic UI elements such as Tableau embeds that fit seamlessly within product documentation. It's popularity makes it easier to find developers who can contribute to the codebase or teach others how to do so. [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) is the most popular React metaframework known for some of the [highest rated](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/#ratios-over-time) developer experiences out there.
2. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) is a commonly used lightweight markup language that allows technical writers to produce content within a "[docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)" framework. This is an established method for application developers and technical writers to work in the most agile way possible with no overhead expenses. It is also the established process for writing technical documentation within this organization.
3. [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/glossary/jamstack/) is the architectural approach that encompasses [SSG](https://jamstack.org/glossary/ssg/) (static site generation) which allows for the generation of complex and dynamic websites through 'builds' which result in a static app that can be hosted freely or inexpensively on some of the fastest web infrastructure, [CDNs](https://jamstack.org/glossary/cdn/).

The combination works great for this use case since it is built to facilitate contributions towards content that fulfill the purpose of this guide while still allowing developers to write a dynamic application with cutting-edge best practices for the web. 

Most technical documentation required to configure, alter or enhance this codebase is updated and maintained by professional teams listed here (in order of importance):

1. [Nextra](https://nextra.site) (docs theme)
2. [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) (framework)
3. [React](https://react.org/) (UI library)

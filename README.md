# Tableau Embedded Analytics Playbook 

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) is the world's leading end-to-end data and analytics platform. 

Leverage the analytical powerhouse that surges forth from the combined efforts of teams who use Tableau to analyze and visualize data. This playbook will teach you how to compose Tableau's varied [product capabilities](https://www.tableau.com/products/our-platform) into analytical experiences that thrill customers, coworkers and friends!

Beyond creating visual representations of data, Tableau provides the greatest benefits as it helps people discover what information is valuable to others. It enables users to analyze data and build the interfaces that represent 
them with unmatched speed and flexibility resulting in a springboarding of ideas into value.

## About the Playbook

The Playbook was created with [Nextra](https://nextra.site), a documentation template built with the [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) web framework that uses [React](https://react.org/) to generate cutting-edge static webapps while content is comfortably written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). The app can be hosted on [Nextjs](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=home), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and other [static hosts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#deploying).

This architecture was selected for the following reasons:
1. React provides a modern, components-based UI that is great for creating UI elements such as Tableau embeds that fit seamlessly within product documentation.
2. Markdown

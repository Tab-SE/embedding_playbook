# Contributing

Contributions to this project are more than welcome and may come in the form of enhancements to the codebase, writing articles, correcting or identifying bugs or even suggesting improvements.

This project has two separate contribution models, one designed for writing articles and the other intended for maintaining the codebase. [ABOUT.md](.github/ABOUT.md) explains how the architecture chosen for this app enables a twin contribution model.

Most contributions will come in the form of articles. Writing high-quality guidance for embedding Tableau is the main purpose of this project.

## Developers

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To ensure smooth collaboration, we ask contributors to follow these best practices:

**Feature Branches**: When making contributions, please create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix. This helps keep the main codebase clean and allows maintainers to review your changes more effectively.

**Problem Statement**: Ensure that your code solves a specific problem or implements a particular feature. This clarity helps maintainers understand the purpose of your contribution and streamline the review process. The best practice is to create an
[issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) on the repository and mention it with [closing statements](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) on the pull request.

For more information on how to create feature branches and submit pull requests, please refer to the GitHub documentation on [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). We appreciate your contributions and look forward to working with you!
